_**Notice:** This first post is a bit late due to the delay on getting my website started._

For the summer of 2019, I was offered a research position at Purdue University through
NSF REU funding granted by [Dr. Felix Lin](https://fxlin.github.io/) to help his lab
[XSEL](https://thexsel.github.io/). The project is officially called _Building Computer
Systems Software for AI and IoT_. A brief description can be found from
[here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Research/SURF/Research):

> While the mobile computers are still flourishing, we are quickly embracing a variety of
> new computing paradigms -- wearables, IoT, and VR headsets,just to name a few. They challenge
> the way we design and build computer software today. In this project, you will be involved in
> redefining systems software to make computers smarter, faster and cooler. This project will
> give you a lot of fun in hacking Linux, frameworks, and various modern hardware.
