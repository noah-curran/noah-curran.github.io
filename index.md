I'm a fourth year PhD student at the University of Michigan, where I study semi-autonomous vehicle
safety, security, and reliability in the <a href="https://rtcl.eecs.umich.edu/rtclweb/">Real-Time Computing Lab</a>.
I feel blessed and lucky to work with my advisor <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kgshin/">Prof. Kang G. Shin</a>.

Feel free to email me if you want to chat. If you'd like to connect, the only social media I
am currently active on is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-curran">LinkedIn</a>.
For personal reasons, I made the choice to abstain from using other mainstream forms of social media
(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), but for archival purposes left my accounts abandoned and undeleted.
If you see my name out there it is probably associated with one of these abandoned accounts.

Something I consider orthogonal to my studies is the ethics of technology and how it impacts society.
Pervasive technologies have propagated through every facet of life, so the onus of responsible research
and development lies on the shoulders of us technology professionals. This ethical responsibility is what
motivates my interest in making autonomous vehicles (and other autonomous robotics systems) safe.
Someday when I have more wisdom to share, I hope to find the time and energy to start a blog on this topic.
