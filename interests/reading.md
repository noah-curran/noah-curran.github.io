I want to give a short story...

When I was younger, I was constantly reading books -- late into the night, 
during my classes, or in the car on road trips. When I got a bit older and 
a lot busier, the whimsical fantasy worlds became something of the past. 
The years went by and for most of them I hadn't read an ounce of fiction 
that wasn't required by my schoolwork. At the start of my graduate studies, 
I gave serious thought to this: "why not read again?" I think at the time I 
yearned for some of the simplicity that came with being a kid. (I wasn't 
thinking about this, but the real answer is pretty simple. I stopped reading 
mostly because I became obsessed with my studies and focusing on my career 
growth. On the other hand I was becoming pretty unhappy without a ton of 
fun in life and pretty reasonably I wanted it back. I similarly gave up 
most television, sports, video games, and regular competitive exercising 
once I entered college. The fun I had definitely wasn't at zero, but it was 
less than that of a normal person. I don't really regret my choices, but I also 
don't think I could make them again.) So, I picked up a few fiction novels 
and read through them. After a few years of this, I can safely say that it 
was a good choice. So many good ideas can come from the fantasy and science 
fiction authors of yesterday and today. The way their words paint the future 
are inspiring, scary, thought-provoking, and, above all else, creative. The 
core skill required of a scientist is to have the creativity to turn nothing 
into something. I feel this is pretty similar skill required of fantasy and 
science fiction authors. To take myself back to the child-like imagination, 
I decided I'll keep working on this hobby.

Unfortunately, deciding to resume an old hobby during graduate school is 
some pretty bad timing. When can I find time to read for fun when there 
is already so much to read for graduate school? I didn't really have a problem 
reincorporating other fun back into my life, but reading more after a long day 
of reading is a pretty lofty ask. Luckily, Ann Arbor is home to a pretty decent 
public transportation system and a multitude of amazing local coffee shops. I 
have been fortunate enough to use it for my commute to and from the university 
each day, and get a few pages of reading during those rides. On the occasional 
free weekend, I'll take whatever book I'm reading to a coffee shop and read 
until I need to head home. Otherwise, I get a bulk of reading done during 
flights when I'm traveling, while relaxing on a vacation, and during the 
evenings when I'm feeling a bit of insomnia. (Reading under the shine of a 
book light really takes me back to what it was like reading as a kid.)

I'm keeping a running list of what I end up reading here. It's mostly 
for myself, but if you're curious about any of the books I'm reading or 
have any recommendations, reach out to me! It's an easy ice-breaker for 
getting to know me.
