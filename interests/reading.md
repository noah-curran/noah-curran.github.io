I want to share a short story...

When I was younger, I constantly read booksâ€”late into the night, during classes, 
or on road trips. As I got older and busier, those whimsical fantasy worlds 
faded away. For years, I didn't read any fiction outside of school requirements. 
At the start of my graduate studies, I wondered, "Why not read again?" I yearned 
for the simplicity of childhood. I had stopped reading because I became obsessed 
with my studies and career, which made life less fun. Though I don't regret my 
choices, I wouldn't make them again. So, I gave it a shot: I picked up a few 
fiction novels and read through them. After a few years, I can say it was a good 
choice. Fantasy and science fiction authors inspire, scare, and provoke thought. 
Their creativity is similar to the core skill of a scientist: turning nothing 
into something. To reconnect with my child-like imagination, I decided to keep reading.

However, resuming an old hobby during graduate school isn't easy. Finding time to 
read for fun is challenging when there's so much to read for school. Fortunately, 
Ann Arbor has a good public transportation system and many great coffee shops. I 
use my commute to read and visit coffee shops on free weekends. I also read during 
flights, vacations, and evenings when I have insomnia. (Reading under a book light 
takes me back to my childhood.)

I'm keeping a list of what I read here. It's mostly for myself, but if you're 
curious or have recommendations, reach out! It's an easy way to get to know me.
